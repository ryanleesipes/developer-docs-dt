Thunderbird Developer Documentation
===================================

This is a collection of documentation specific to Thunderbird development. Much of the existing
documentation on `MDN`__ is either Firefox-specific or seriously out-of-date. As time permits I
am collecting what I know about developing Thunderbird and publishing it here. If you'd like to
contribute anything, please fork `the repository on GitHub`__ and send a pull request.

If you're looking for information about making new extensions for Thunderbird, see `the
Thunderbird WebExtensions documentation`__.
