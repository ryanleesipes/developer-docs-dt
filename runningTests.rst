=============
Running Tests
=============

Thunderbird has three test suites, that each test different aspects of the program.

XPCShell
========

XPCShell tests test Thunderbird's components, without opening the user interface. Firefox also runs
this type of test, and much of the information about Firefox's XPCShell tests also apply to
Thunderbird.

To run an XPCShell test, or a directory of them, use mach:

.. code-block:: shell

  mach xpcshell-test comm/mail/components/extensions/test/xpcshell

``mach`` must point to mach. The path argument is always relative to the mozilla-central root, so
include ``comm/`` at the start.

If more than one test runs, just a summary of the results will be displayed. You can pass
``--verbose`` to get the full output if necessary.

.. note::

  You may notice a long pause when running tests for the first time after building. Mach is
  reindexing the tests.

Mochitest
=========

Like XPCShell tests, mochitests are a type of test used on Firefox. The main difference is that
mochitest runs with the full UI, in the context of the main mail window.

To run a mochitest, or a directory of them, use mach:

.. code-block:: shell

  mach mochitest mail/components/extensions/test/browser

``mach`` must point to mach. The path argument is **not** relative to the mozilla-central root, it
points directly at the test in the source directory.

.. note::

  You may notice a long pause when running tests for the first time after building. Mach is
  reindexing the tests.

Mozmill
=======

Mozmill is a test suite for the Thunderbird user interface. It simulates a user's actions, in a
"click this button", or "enter this text" kind of way, rather than interacting directly with the
program's code.

Mozmill tests are located in ``mail/test/mozmill``, except for calendar tests (see below).
You can run one test or a whole directory.

.. code-block:: shell

  # Runs a single test.
  make -C objdir/ SOLO_TEST=pref-window/test-attachments-pane.js mozmill-one

  # Runs a directory of tests.
  make -C objdir/ SOLO_TEST=pref-window mozmill-one

You can run these commands from anywhere, as long as the ``-C`` argument points to your objdir. 

Calendar Mozmill tests
----------------------

The mozmill tests for the Lightning extension are located in ``calendar/test/mozmill``.
Running them is the same as above, but the ``-C`` argument is different.

.. code-block:: shell

  make -C objdir/comm/calendar/test/mozmill SOLO_TEST=testAlarmDefaultValue.js mozmill-one

.. tip::

  You may prefer to run tests using a profile stored in memory, rather than on the disk. Tests do
  a lot of file I/O, so running them with an in-memory profile can be faster.

  On Linux you can do this by setting the TEMP environment variable to ``/dev/shm``, a filesystem
  stored in memory: run ``export TEMP=/dev/shm`` before running tests. All three test suites
  support this, except XPCShell when running more than one test for some reason.
